I’ve attempted a few times over the years to get a blog up and
running, hopefully this time it’ll stick. I’ll be blogging about quite
a few things.

*   Programming/Web Development
*   Music, Engineering, Production – probably a few Pro Tools
*   screencasts
*   Life in general, mainly inspired by my impending fatherhood.

Hope whoever reads enjoys the ride!
