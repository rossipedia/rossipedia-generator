I've found that one of the most useful skills I have is knowing what
to forget. Let me ask a question to demonstrate my point.

Which of the following pieces of data is more useful?

1. Knowing the entire API of `System.Collections.Generic.List<>'
2. Knowing how to search the MSDN docs for the API to `List<>`

I forget orders of magnitude more things about programming in an
average day than what I remember. But what I _do_ remember are the
important pieces of information that I can use to find what I need.
