I usually don’t bother with the fanboyism, but I’ve been playing around with iOS
6 beta, and just found something cool.

I thought that the auto-brightness feature just wasn’t working. Turns out I
wasn’t paying good enough attention.

Apparently, the brightness transition is now just super slow. So slow, I didn’t
realize it was happening. So subtle that I didn’t consciously realize that my
iPhone was just always readable.

Hats off to you, Apple.
