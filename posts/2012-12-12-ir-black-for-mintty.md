Wanted to get an IR_Black color scheme for .mintty to match vim, so I
whipped up the following:

```bash
Black             = 78,78,78
Blue              = 150,203,254
Cyan              = 198,197,254
Green             = 168,255,96
Magenta           = 255,115,253
Red               = 255,108,96
White             = 238,238,238
Yellow            = 255,255,182
BoldBlack         = 124,124,124
BoldBlue          = 181,220,254
BoldCyan          = 223,223,254
BoldGreen         = 206,255,171
BoldMagenta       = 255,156,254
BoldRed           = 255,182,176
BoldWhite         = 255,255,255
BoldYellow        = 255,255,203
```

Just add this to your `~/.minttyrc` file, and you're good to go.
