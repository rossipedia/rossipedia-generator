I’ve spent most of my life trying to avoid unnecessary conflict. Most of the
time it works out for me. I hate dealing with stress, and most of the time it
seems to me that many people tend to react to situations in stressful ways that
are completely unneeded.

However...

Recently I’ve been coming to a pretty startling conclusion:

> Nothing worthwhile will ever be attained without struggle, conflict, and to
> some degree – pain. Nothing.

<!-- more -->

Personally I think it comes from the fact that in a couple of months I’m going
to become a father, so the concept of birth has been rattling around my skull.
And birth is, by all accounts, a rather painful struggle.

But it’s worth it.

And that’s the crux. The things you never have to work for, have to bleed for,
aren’t worth a damn. So that whole idea about seeking to avoid conflict?
Here’s a thought...

What if I didn’t?

Now, that’s not to say I’m going to go around picking fights. That wouldn’t be
conducive towards survival, really. Rather, I’ve found that the whole avoidance
of "unnecessary" conflict and stress hasn’t really got me anywhere. And that’s
because it’s never unnecessary. The forward progress of life and creation
depends on it.
