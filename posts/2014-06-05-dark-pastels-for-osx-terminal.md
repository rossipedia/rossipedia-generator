I've been working a lot in Ubuntu lately, and my terminal of choice over there
is the [xfce4-terminal](http://docs.xfce.org/apps/terminal/start), specifically
for it's "Dark Pastels" theme.

I wanted to have this same color scheme in my OSX Terminal.app. So I copied the
colors over, and here it is!

[Dark Pastels for OSX Terminal.app](/assets/dark-pastels-terminal.theme)

Just unzip and double click the `Dark Pastels.terminal` file and it should load
right up.
