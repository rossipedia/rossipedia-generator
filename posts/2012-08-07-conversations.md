I keep hearing people talking about “conversations” in software development.
Like somehow “conversations” are super important.

This is bothering me. In my experience, conversations for their own sake are
the devil. They interfere with actual development.

Get the job done, get something that works, get it out the door. Don’t bother
talking about it unless there’s absolutely no way around it.
